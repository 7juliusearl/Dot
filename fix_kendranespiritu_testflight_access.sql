-- üîß FIX TESTFLIGHT ACCESS: kendranespiritu@gmail.com
-- Customer ID: cus_SROKz1r6tv7kzd

-- ========================================
-- 1. FIRST, CHECK CURRENT STATE
-- ========================================
-- Check if stripe_customers record exists

  created_at

-- ========================================
-- 2. CREATE/UPDATE STRIPE_CUSTOMERS RECORD
-- ========================================
-- Insert or update stripe_customers record to ensure TestFlight access
