  # EMERGENCY FIX: Payment Method Data Issue Resurfaced (2025)
  
  ## SITUATION:
  The payment method last4 digits and subscription type issue has resurfaced.
  Users are seeing fake data like 'cac6', '37d8', or '...' instead of real card digits.
  
  ## ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
  1. Some webhook handlers might not be capturing payment method data properly
  2. Recent migrations might have introduced fake data generation
  3. Subscription type data might not be syncing correctly
  
  ## COMPREHENSIVE FIX:
*/

-- Step 1: EMERGENCY DATA QUALITY CHECK
SELECT 
  'CURRENT CRISIS ANALYSIS' as alert_type,
  COUNT(*) as total_orders,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN payment_method_last4 ~ '^[0-9]{4}$' THEN 1 END) as real_card_digits,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN payment_method_last4 = '****' THEN 1 END) as clean_placeholder,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN payment_method_last4 ~ '^[a-f0-9]{4}$' AND payment_method_last4 !~ '^[0-9]{4}$' THEN 1 END) as md5_fake_data,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN payment_method_last4 ~ '[^0-9*]' THEN 1 END) as other_fake_data,
  ROUND((COUNT(CASE WHEN payment_method_last4 !~ '^[0-9]{4}$' AND payment_method_last4 != '****' THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*)), 2) as crisis_percentage
FROM stripe_orders 
WHERE status = 'completed' AND deleted_at IS NULL;

-- Step 2: IDENTIFY THE WORST OFFENDERS (recent fake data)
SELECT 
  'RECENT FAKE DATA (Last 7 days)' as recent_crisis,
  sc.email,
  so.payment_intent_id,
  so.payment_method_last4,

  AND so.payment_method_last4 !~ '^[0-9]{4}$'

-- Step 3: NUCLEAR CLEANUP - Reset ALL fake data immediately
UPDATE stripe_orders

UPDATE stripe_orders

  AND subscription_status IS NULL
