# Netlify MCP Integration for Direct Deployment

You have access to the Netlify MCP server which allows you to:
- Deploy this project directly to Netlify
- Manage Netlify sites and deployments
- Handle environment variables and site configuration
- Create and manage domains

When the user asks to deploy to Netlify, use the Netlify MCP tools to:
1. Create or update the Netlify site
2. Deploy the built application
3. Configure any necessary environment variables
4. Provide the live URL

For deployment, ensure the project is built first with `npm run build` and then deploy the `dist` folder.

The current project is a React/TypeScript application that needs:
- VITE_SUPABASE_URL environment variable
- VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY environment variable
