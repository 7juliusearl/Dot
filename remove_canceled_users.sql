-- Remove Canceled Users from TestFlight Access
-- This script helps you identify and soft-delete users who have canceled

-- ===== STEP 1: IDENTIFY CANCELED USERS =====
-- First, let's see who has canceled (useful to identify who to remove)

SELECT 
  '=== USERS TO REMOVE FROM TESTFLIGHT ===' as info,
  sc.email,
  sc.payment_type,
  so.subscription_status,
  sc.created_at,

    ELSE '‚ùì OTHER'
  END as reason

LEFT JOIN stripe_orders so ON sc.customer_id = so.customer_id
WHERE so.subscription_status IN ('canceled', 'unpaid', 'past_due')
  AND sc.deleted_at IS NULL
  AND so.deleted_at IS NULL
ORDER BY sc.created_at DESC;

-- Alternative: Find users who might have canceled subscriptions
-- (Check if they have any Stripe subscription data that indicates cancellation)
SELECT 
  '=== POTENTIAL CANCELED USERS (Alternative Check) ===' as info,
  email,
  payment_type,
  created_at,

    FROM stripe_orders 
    WHERE subscription_status IN ('canceled', 'unpaid', 'past_due')
      AND deleted_at IS NULL
  )
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- ===== STEP 2: SOFT DELETE SPECIFIC USER =====
-- Replace 'user@example.com' with the actual email of canceled user

DO $$
DECLARE
  user_email text := 'user@example.com'; -- ‚ö†Ô∏è CHANGE THIS EMAIL
  target_customer_id text;
  affected_rows integer;

-- ===== STEP 3: BULK DELETE ALL CANCELED USERS =====
-- ‚ö†Ô∏è UNCOMMENT ONLY IF YOU WANT TO REMOVE ALL CANCELED USERS AT ONCE

-- ===== STEP 4: VERIFY RESULTS =====
SELECT 
  '=== VERIFICATION: CURRENT ACTIVE USERS ===' as info,

  COUNT(*) as removed_users,
  MIN(deleted_at) as first_removal,
  MAX(deleted_at) as last_removal
FROM stripe_customers 
WHERE deleted_at IS NOT NULL;

-- ===== STEP 5: CHECK SPECIFIC USER'S SUBSCRIPTION STATUS =====
-- Use this to check the status of a specific user before removing them

/*
SELECT 
  '=== USER STATUS CHECK ===' as info,
  sc.email,
  sc.payment_type,
  sc.created_at as customer_created,

-- ===== RESTORE A USER (IF NEEDED) =====
-- If you accidentally soft-delete someone or they resubscribe

/*
