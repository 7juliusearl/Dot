-- Remove Canceled Users from TestFlight Access
-- This script helps you identify and soft-delete users who have canceled

-- ===== STEP 1: IDENTIFY CANCELED USERS =====
SELECT 
  '=== USERS TO REMOVE FROM TESTFLIGHT ===' as info,
  email,
  payment_type,
  subscription_status,
  created_at,
  CASE 
    WHEN subscription_status = 'canceled' THEN '‚ùå CANCELED'

    WHEN subscription_status = 'past_due' THEN '‚è∞ PAST DUE'
    ELSE '‚ùì OTHER'
  END as reason
FROM stripe_customers 
WHERE subscription_status IN ('canceled', 'unpaid', 'past_due')
  AND deleted_at IS NULL
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- ===== STEP 2: SOFT DELETE SPECIFIC USER =====
-- Replace 'user@example.com' with the actual email of canceled user

DO $$
DECLARE
  user_email text := 'user@example.com'; -- ‚ö†Ô∏è CHANGE THIS EMAIL
  target_customer_id text;
  affected_rows integer;
BEGIN
  -- Get customer ID
  SELECT customer_id INTO target_customer_id

  WHERE email = user_email AND deleted_at IS NULL;
  
  IF target_customer_id IS NULL THEN
    RAISE NOTICE '‚ùå User % not found or already deleted', user_email;
    RETURN;
  END IF;
  
  -- Soft delete from stripe_customers
  UPDATE stripe_customers 
  SET deleted_at = NOW(), updated_at = NOW()

  RAISE NOTICE '‚úÖ Soft deleted user: %', user_email;
  RAISE NOTICE 'üö´ User will no longer have TestFlight access';
  RAISE NOTICE 'üìä Data preserved for analytics';
END $$;

-- ===== STEP 3: BULK DELETE ALL CANCELED USERS =====
-- ‚ö†Ô∏è UNCOMMENT ONLY IF YOU WANT TO REMOVE ALL CANCELED USERS AT ONCE

/*
DO $$
DECLARE
  deleted_count integer;
BEGIN
  -- Soft delete all canceled users
