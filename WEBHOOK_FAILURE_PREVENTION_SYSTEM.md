# Webhook Failure Prevention System

## Root Cause Analysis
The southernhoney issue occurred because:
1. **Stripe processed payment successfully** ($27.99 yearly subscription)
2. **Webhook failed to create order record** in database
3. **Customer appeared in dashboard as "No Active Subscription"**
4. **Revenue was collected but access was denied**

## Prevention Strategy

### 1. Real-Time Monitoring System

**Automated Webhook Health Checks:**
```sql
-- Add to weekly_cancellation_check.sql
-- Check for payments without corresponding orders (webhook failures)
SELECT 
  'WEBHOOK FAILURE ALERT' as alert_type,
  COUNT(*) as missing_orders,
  STRING_AGG(sc.email, ', ') as affected_customers
FROM stripe_customers sc
LEFT JOIN stripe_orders so ON sc.customer_id = so.customer_id 
  AND so.status = 'completed' 
  AND so.deleted_at IS NULL
WHERE sc.subscription_status = 'active'
  AND sc.deleted_at IS NULL
  AND so.customer_id IS NULL;
```

**Daily Revenue Reconciliation:**
- Compare Stripe dashboard revenue vs database order totals
- Alert if discrepancy > $50 or > 5% of daily revenue
- Run at 9 AM daily via GitHub Actions

### 2. Webhook Redundancy System

**Primary Prevention:**
- âœ… Already implemented: `netlify/functions/stripe-webhook-complete.mts`
- âœ… Handles both subscription and payment events
- âœ… Creates both customer and order records

**Secondary Prevention:**
- **Backup webhook endpoint** at different URL
- **Retry mechanism** with exponential backoff
- **Dead letter queue** for failed webhook processing

### 3. Automatic Recovery System

**Customer-Triggered Recovery:**
When customer reports "No Active Subscription":

1. **Instant Stripe Lookup:**
```typescript
// Add to netlify/functions/recover-missing-payment.mts
export default async (req: Request) => {
  const { email } = await req.json();
  
  // 1. Find customer in Stripe
  const customers = await stripe.customers.list({ email, limit: 1 });
  if (!customers.data.length) return { error: 'No Stripe customer found' };
  
  // 2. Get recent payments
  const payments = await stripe.paymentIntents.list({
    customer: customers.data[0].id,
    limit: 10
  });
  
  // 3. Auto-create missing orders
  for (const payment of payments.data) {
    if (payment.status === 'succeeded') {
      // Create missing order record
      await createMissingOrder(payment);
    }
  }
};
```

2. **Emergency Order Creation:**
- Use same logic as `EMERGENCY_FIX_southernhoney_FINAL.sql`
- Automatic price detection from Stripe
- Immediate access restoration

### 4. Monitoring Dashboard

**Weekly Automated Report:**
- Total revenue: Stripe vs Database
- Missing orders count
- Failed webhook attempts
- Customer access issues

**Real-Time Alerts:**
- Slack/email notification for webhook failures
- SMS alert for revenue discrepancies > $100
- Dashboard widget showing webhook health

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Immediate (This Week)
1. âœ… Deploy fixed webhook system
2. âœ… Create emergency recovery procedures
3. ðŸ”„ Add daily revenue reconciliation check
4. ðŸ”„ Set up Slack webhook failure alerts

### Phase 2: Automated Recovery (Next Week)
1. Build customer self-service recovery endpoint
2. Create admin dashboard for webhook monitoring
3. Implement automatic retry system
4. Add comprehensive logging

### Phase 3: Advanced Monitoring (Month 2)
1. Revenue analytics dashboard
2. Predictive failure detection
3. Customer satisfaction tracking
4. Performance optimization

## Success Metrics
- **Zero revenue loss** from webhook failures
- **< 5 minute** customer issue resolution time
- **99.9%** webhook success rate
- **100%** customer access accuracy

## Emergency Contacts
- **Webhook failures:** Check Netlify function logs
- **Revenue discrepancies:** Compare Stripe dashboard vs database
- **Customer issues:** Use emergency recovery SQL scripts
- **System outages:** Deploy backup webhook endpoint
