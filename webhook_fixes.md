# Stripe Webhook Fixes - Prevent NULL Values & "not_started" Issues

## 🔍 Problems Found:

1. **Wrong Default Status**: Webhook sets `status: 'not_started'` when subscription data isn't found
2. **Timing Issues**: Tries to fetch subscription data immediately after checkout (Stripe needs time to process)
3. **Missing Retry Logic**: No retry mechanism when Stripe API calls fail
4. **Inconsistent Data**: Creates orders but may fail to sync subscriptions properly

## 🛠️ Solutions:

### 1. Fix Immediate Issues in Webhook
- Change default status from "not_started" to "active" for completed checkouts
- Add retry logic with delays
- Better error handling and logging

### 2. Add Monitoring & Alerts
- Alert when subscriptions stay "not_started" for >24 hours
- Daily cleanup job for orphaned records
- Webhook failure notifications

### 3. Backup Processing
- Scheduled job to fix incomplete data
- Retry failed webhook processing
- Sync with Stripe daily for consistency

## 🚀 Implementation Plan:

### Phase 1: Emergency Webhook Fix (Now)
- Fix the syncSubscriptionData function
- Improve error handling
- Add retries with exponential backoff

### Phase 2: Monitoring Setup (This Week)
- Add alerts for "not_started" subscriptions
- Create cleanup automation
- Set up webhook failure monitoring

### Phase 3: Long-term Reliability (Next Week)
- Daily sync job with Stripe
- Data consistency checks
- Automated reconciliation

## ⚡ Immediate Actions Needed:

1. **Update webhook code** (fixes the root cause)
2. **Add monitoring query** (catch future issues)
3. **Create cleanup automation** (fix any stragglers)
