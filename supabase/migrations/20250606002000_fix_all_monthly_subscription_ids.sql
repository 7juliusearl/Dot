  # Fix missing subscription data for all monthly users
  
  1. Problem
    - Monthly users missing subscription_id can't cancel subscriptions
    - Dashboard cancel button requires: subscription_id + active status + monthly type
    - Some users migrated without proper subscription data
  
  2. Solution
    - Generate subscription_ids for monthly users who don't have them
    - Set proper subscription_status, price_id, billing periods
    - Ensure cancel button works for all monthly subscribers
