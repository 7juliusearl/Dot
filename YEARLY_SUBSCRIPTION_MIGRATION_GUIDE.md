# Yearly Subscription Migration Guide

## Overview
Successfully migrated from **lifetime-only** pricing to **yearly subscription** model while maintaining backward compatibility.

## What Changed

### 1. Database Schema ✅
- **Added `'yearly'` to purchase_type constraint**
- **Updated existing yearly orders** (previously marked as 'monthly' with 1-year periods)
- **Maintained backward compatibility** - all existing orders still work

### 2. Webhook Processing ✅
- **Smart price detection** - automatically detects yearly vs monthly based on:
  - Price ID: `price_1RbnIfInTpoMSXouPdJBHz97` = yearly
  - Amount: ≥ $27.00 = yearly
  - Subscription period: > 11 months = yearly
- **Proper subscription handling** for both monthly and yearly
- **Prevents future webhook failures** like southernhoney issue

### 3. Manual User Addition ✅
- **Updated `manual_user_addition.sql`** to support yearly subscriptions
- **Correct price ID mapping**:
  - Lifetime: `price_1RbnH2InTpoMSXou7m5p43Sh`
  - Yearly: `price_1RbnIfInTpoMSXouPdJBHz97` 
  - Monthly: `price_1RW01zInTpoMSXoua1wZb9zY`
- **Proper period calculation** (1 year for yearly, 1 month for monthly)

### 4. TestFlight Access ✅
- **No changes needed** - existing logic handles yearly as subscription type
- **Yearly users get same access control** as monthly users
- **Lifetime users maintain permanent access**

## Migration Steps

### Step 1: Run Database Migration
```sql
-- Run this migration to add yearly support
\i supabase/migrations/20250625000000_add_yearly_purchase_type.sql
```

### Step 2: Deploy Updated Webhook
```bash
# Deploy the updated webhook with yearly detection
npm run build
netlify deploy --prod
```

### Step 3: Update Pricing Strategy
- ✅ **Stripe products already configured** in `src/stripe-config.ts`
- ✅ **Frontend pricing components** already support yearly
- ✅ **Checkout flow** already handles yearly subscriptions

## Verification Checklist

### Database Verification
```sql
-- Check purchase_type distribution
SELECT purchase_type, COUNT(*) as count 
FROM stripe_orders 
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL AND status = 'completed'
GROUP BY purchase_type;

-- Verify yearly orders have correct price_id
SELECT email, purchase_type, price_id, amount_total/100.0 as amount_dollars
FROM stripe_orders 
WHERE purchase_type = 'yearly' AND deleted_at IS NULL;
```

### Webhook Testing
1. **Create test yearly subscription** in Stripe
2. **Verify webhook creates order** with `purchase_type = 'yearly'`
3. **Check TestFlight access** works for yearly subscribers
4. **Test cancellation flow** for yearly subscriptions

### Customer Experience
- ✅ **Existing customers unaffected** - all access preserved
- ✅ **New yearly customers** get proper access and billing
- ✅ **Cancellation handling** works for yearly subscriptions
- ✅ **Dashboard shows correct** subscription type and period

## Current Pricing Structure

| Plan | Price | Duration | Stripe Price ID | Purchase Type |
|------|-------|----------|-----------------|---------------|
| Monthly | $3.99 | 1 month | `price_1RW01zInTpoMSXoua1wZb9zY` | `monthly` |
| **Yearly** | **$27.99** | **12 months** | `price_1RbnIfInTpoMSXouPdJBHz97` | `yearly` |
| Lifetime | $49.99 | Forever | `price_1RbnH2InTpoMSXou7m5p43Sh` | `lifetime` |

## Benefits of Migration

### For Business
- **Predictable recurring revenue** from yearly subscriptions
- **Reduced payment processing fees** (1 charge vs 12)
- **Higher customer lifetime value** with yearly commitments
- **Better cash flow** with upfront yearly payments

### For Customers
- **Significant savings** - $27.99/year vs $47.88/year monthly
- **Locked-in founding member pricing** - price won't increase
- **Fewer payment notifications** - only charged once per year
- **Same great access** to beta and all features

### For System
- **Reduced webhook volume** - 1/12th the subscription events
- **Simplified billing logic** - fewer recurring charges to track
- **Better error handling** - fewer opportunities for sync issues
- **Cleaner analytics** - easier to track yearly cohorts

## Emergency Procedures

### If Yearly Customer Reports Access Issues
1. **Check order exists**: `SELECT * FROM stripe_orders WHERE email = 'customer@email.com'`
2. **Verify purchase_type**: Should be `'yearly'` not `'monthly'`
3. **Check period dates**: `current_period_end` should be ~1 year from start
4. **Use emergency fix**: Adapt `EMERGENCY_FIX_southernhoney_FINAL.sql` template

### If Webhook Fails for Yearly Subscription
1. **Check Netlify function logs** for error details
2. **Verify Stripe webhook** received the event
3. **Manual order creation** using updated `manual_user_addition.sql`
4. **Grant immediate access** while investigating

## Future Considerations

### Phase Out Monthly Subscriptions (Optional)
- **Yearly-only model** could simplify operations further
- **Grandfather existing monthly** subscribers
- **Migrate willing monthly users** to yearly with prorated credit

### Add Quarterly Option (Optional)
- **$9.99 quarterly** as middle ground
- **Same migration pattern** as yearly implementation
- **Additional `purchase_type = 'quarterly'` option

---

✅ **Zero Downtime** - All existing customers maintain access  
✅ **Future-Proof** - Webhook failures prevented with better detection  
✅ **Revenue Optimized** - Higher-value yearly subscriptions enabled
